# Inventory-Management-System

I developed an Inventory Management System backend using Spring Boot. It manages products with CRUD operations, stock adjustments, and low-stock alerts. The system integrates JPA for database handling, REST APIs for client interaction, and structured service layers for scalability. Postman was used for testing endpoints efficiently.
